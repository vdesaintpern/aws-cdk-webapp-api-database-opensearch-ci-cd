# CDK Fullstack Workshop

This workshop is intented for developers willing to deploy a fullstack web application to AWS using popular tools such as containers, relational database, opensearch engine and single page application frameworks.

You will get an opinionated guidance on:

- organising your source code and CDK stacks,
- deploying stacks manually or with CI/CD based on lifecycle requirements,
- referencing resources in different stacks such as networking environment, credentials, database, OpenSearch or API endpoint
- automating artifact building
- deploying in several environments

The final architecture will look like this:

IMAGE OF ARCH : ReactJS, NodeJS RDS database, typical layers such as VPC, RDS database, Opensearch, Secrets, API on ECS and ReactJS website deployed on S3 / Cloudfront with CI/CD.

NOTE :

To make the most of this workshop, it is recommended to have a baseline understanding of core AWS services, infrastructure as code, CDK, containers and single page applications. 

This workshop is based on ReactJS and NodeJS as a baseline example. This could be adapted for other languages such as python, java or Go.
